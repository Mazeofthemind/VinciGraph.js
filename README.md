Morse-Graph-Visualization
=========================

This is a reference visualization which receives graph data (vertices and edges) from a server and visualizes it in the web browser using 2D (D3.js) and 3D (Three.js) libraries and a variety of static (tree based) and dynamic (force based) arrangement algorithms. It also provides a set of tools to represent the attributes of vertex and edge objects in a variety of visual indicators including color, size and shape.
